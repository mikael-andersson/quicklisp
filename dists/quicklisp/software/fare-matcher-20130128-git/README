THIS LIBRARY IS BEING DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF OPTIMA.
PLEASE USE OPTIMA INSTEAD.

I've decided to consolidate pattern matching libraries.

Optima is a much better library than fare-matcher,
which was a proof of concept, really.

I'll be working with the authors of Optima to make sure
that optima is superior in every possible aspect to fare-matcher,
and will recommend users who use fare-matcher to migrate to optima.

See you there soon!
